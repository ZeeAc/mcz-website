    <p>
        This website was created to communicate the order of the family photoshoot.
        Please note that we have only one hour to take all photos, 
        therefore we must be time-conscious.<br>
        The photoshoot will be starting 9 am and will be held at ART Farm.<br>
        The location is below <br>

        This is our first family photoshoot since 2017, and we plan to make it a memorable occasion.
        Time spent with family is worth capturing, and captured memories are worth savoring forever.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a fun game, let us practice our poses so that we can incorporate our young ones into 
        the photoshoot with ease.

        The colours of the photoshoot are <strong>nude, brown, and white</strong>.
